# OpenRouter Proxy

A simple proxy server for OpenRouter API that helps bypass rate limits on free API keys
by rotating through multiple API keys in a round-robin fashion.

## Features

- **HTTP Compliance**: Full HTTP/1.1 spec compliance with proper chunked encoding
- **Enhanced Metrics Dashboard**: Detailed monitoring at `/metrics` showing:
  - Token statistics (sent/received)
  - Model endpoint caching status
  - Key status (active/in cooldown)
  - System resource usage (CPU/Memory)
  - All standard Prometheus metrics
  - Raw metrics available at `/metrics/raw`
- **Request Tracing**: Unique request IDs for end-to-end logging (X-Request-ID)
- **Configurable Metrics**: Toggle system metrics and token counting in config
- **Health Checks**: Extended endpoint monitoring with `/health` endpoint
- **Key Validation**: Strict API key format enforcement ("sk-or-" prefix, invalid keys rejected at startup)
- **Response Caching**: Built-in caching for /models endpoint with TTL control
- **Streaming Support**: Optimized streaming responses with HTTP/1.1 compliance
- **Environment Support**: API keys can be set via OPENROUTER_KEYS environment variable
- **Production Ready**: Structured logging, performance tracking headers, and graceful shutdown

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Important Note:** Arch Linux and similar distributions manage Python packages through the system package manager. Never install Python packages system-wide! Always use a virtual environment as shown above.

3. Create a configuration file:
   ```
   cp config.yml.example config.yml
   ```
4. Edit `config.yml` to add your OpenRouter API keys and configure the server

## Optional Dependencies

For system resource monitoring (CPU/Memory metrics), install psutil when needed:

```bash
pip install psutil
```

This is only required if you enable `enable_system_metrics: true` in config.yml

## Configuration

The `config.yml` file supports these settings with new production-ready options:

```yaml
# Server settings
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0" # Interface to bind to
  port: 5555 # Port to listen on
  access_key: "your_local_access_key_here" # Authentication key
  log_level: "INFO" # Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  http_log_level: "INFO" # HTTP access logs level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

# OpenRouter API settings
openrouter:
  keys:
    - "sk-or-v1-your-first-api-key"
    - "sk-or-v1-your-second-api-key"
    - "sk-or-v1-your-third-api-key"

  # Cache settings for free models endpoint
  enable_cache: true # Enable response caching
  cache_ttl: 300 # Cache lifetime in seconds (5 minutes)

  base_url: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1" # OpenRouter API endpoint
  public_endpoints: ["/api/v1/models"] # No auth required

  # Key selection strategy: "round-robin" (default), "first" or "random".
  key_selection_strategy: "round-robin"
  # Options: ["same"] to prefer last used key
  key_selection_opts: []

  # When keys get rate limited
  rate_limit_cooldown: 14400 # 4 hours
  free_only: false # Only show free models
  google_rate_delay: 0 # Delay for Google API issues

# Outgoing proxy configuration
requestProxy:
  enabled: false # Enable to use proxy
  url: "socks5://user:pass@proxy.com:1080" # Proxy URL with credentials
```

## Usage

### Running Manually

Simply run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The main process will automatically:

1. Start the Key Management Service in the background
2. Start the API Gateway
3. Manage both services simultaneously

### Installing as a Systemd Service

For Linux systems with systemd, you can install the proxy as a system service:

1. Make sure you've created and configured your `config.yml` file
2. Run the installation script:

`sudo ./service_install.sh` or `sudo ./service_install_venv.sh` for venv.

This will create a systemd service that starts automatically on boot.

To check the service status:

```
sudo systemctl status openrouter-proxy
```

To view logs:

```
sudo journalctl -u openrouter-proxy -f
```

To uninstall the service:

```
sudo ./service_uninstall.sh
```

### Authentication

Add your local access key to requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_local_access_key_here
```

## API Endpoints

The proxy supports all OpenRouter API v1 endpoints through the following endpoint:

- `/api/v1/{path}` - Proxies all requests to OpenRouter API v1

It also provides a health check endpoint:

- `/health` - Health check endpoint that returns `{"status": "ok"}`

## Why

Forked from [Aculeasis openrouter-proxy](https://github.com/Aculeasis/openrouter-proxy). It is my attempt to fix :

1. Conflicting HTTP Headers.
   The http proxy is sending mutually exclusive headers simultaneously:

```
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked
   Content-Length: 407769
```

This violates HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 7230 Section 3.3.3) which prohibits sending both headers together.

2. Duplicate Headers.
   Invalid duplicate headers appear in the http response:

```
   date: Fri, 13 Jun 2025 01:42:55 GMT
   date: Fri, 13 Jun 2025 01:42:56 GMT  # Duplicate!
   server: uvicorn
   server: cloudflare  # Duplicate!
```

Thus making it unusable in Big-AGI [big-AGI](https://github.com/enricoros/big-AGI).

3. Additionally, a proof of concept demonstrating how an AI coding companion (like Aider in my case) can assist someone like me, with zero knowledge of Python programming to fix issues they previously deemed impossible without extensive learning.
